                        Old Delhi, in the north, the historic city; and New Delhi, in the south, since 1947 the capital of India, built in the 
                        first part of the 20th century as the capital of British India.<br><br><br>
                        One of the countryâ€™s largest urban agglomerations, Delhi sits astride (but primarily on the west bank of) the
                        Yamuna River, a tributary of the Ganges (Ganga) River, about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Himalayas. 
                        The national capital territory embraces Old and New Delhi and the surrounding metropolitan region, as well as adjacent 
                        rural areas. To the east the territory is bounded by the state of Uttar Pradesh, and to the north, west, and south it is 
                        bounded by the state of Haryana.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:0" class="history-p">Delhi has a long history, and has been an important political centre of India as the capital of 
                        several empires.[1] Earliest coverage of Delhi's history is in the onset of the Tomar's kingdom in the 8th century. 
                        Since then, Delhi has been the centre of a succession of mighty empires and powerful kingdoms, making Delhi one of the
                         longest-serving capitals and one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world. It is considered to be a city built, 
                         destroyed and rebuilt several times, as outsiders who successfully invaded the Indian Subcontinent would ransack the 
                         existing capital city in Delhi, and those who came to conquer and stay would be so impressed by the city's strategic 
                         location as to make it their capital and rebuild it in their own way.
                        <br><br>
                        During the Vedic period, Delhi was the site of Indraprastha or Indrapat,[4] an Indo-Aryan city in the Khandava Forest 
                        which served as a capital of the Kuru Kingdom, the first recorded state-level society in the Indian subcontinent.
                        <br><br>
                        In the medieval era, Delhi was ruled by the Tomara dynasty and Chauhan from 736 to 1193. 
                        The Delhi Sultanate is the name given for a series of five successive dynasties, which remained as a 
                        dominant power of Indian subcontinent with Delhi as their capital.</p>
